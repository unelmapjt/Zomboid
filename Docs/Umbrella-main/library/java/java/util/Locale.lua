---Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
--- this locale.
---
--- If this Locale has a language, country, or
--- variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
--- syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
--- described below:
---
--- Language: If language is empty, or not well-formed (for example "a" or
--- "e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).
---
--- Country: If country is not well-formed (for example "12" or "USA"),
--- it will be omitted.
---
--- Variant: If variant is well-formed, each sub-segment
--- (delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag.  Otherwise:
---
---
--- if all sub-segments match [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}
--- (for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
--- ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
--- the private use subtag.  The first appended subtag will be
--- "lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
--- hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
--- "Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".
---
--- if any sub-segment does not match
--- [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}, the variant will be truncated
--- and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
--- will be omitted.  If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
--- emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
--- turns out to be well-formed).  For example,
--- "Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
--- "x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".
---
--- Special Conversions: Java supports some old locale
--- representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
--- for compatibility. This method performs the following
--- conversions:
---
---
--- Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
--- converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.
---
--- A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
--- "NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
--- to a language tag "nn-NO".
---
--- Note: Although the language tag created by this
--- method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
--- defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
--- necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag.  For example,
---
---   new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();
---
--- will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
--- region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
--- in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

---Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.

--- If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
--- the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored.  Compare
--- to Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String) which throws an exception
--- in this case.
---
--- The following conversions are performed:
---
--- The language code "und" is mapped to language "".
---
--- The language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are mapped to "he",
--- "yi", and "id" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
--- that's done in Locale's constructors.) See
--- Legacy language codes
--- for more information.
---
--- The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
--- if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
--- result locale (without case normalization).  If it is then
--- empty, the private use subtag is discarded:
---
---
---     Locale loc;
---     loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
---     loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
---     loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null
---
---     loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
---     loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
---     loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
---
---
--- When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
--- the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
--- language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:
---
---
---     Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
---     Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
---
---
--- Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
--- unchanged.  Language is normalized to lower case, script to
--- title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
--- case.
---
--- If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
--- ja_JP_JP or th_TH_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
--- extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:
---
---
---    Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
---    // returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
---    Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
---    // returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
---
---
--- This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
--- so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
--- "Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
--- private use language tags.  Stand alone private use tags are
--- represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
--- and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
--- where they exist.
