---(Not exposed)
---A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at
--- both ends.  The name deque is short for "double ended queue"
--- and is usually pronounced "deck".  Most Deque
--- implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements
--- they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted
--- deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.
---
--- This interface defines methods to access the elements at both
--- ends of the deque.  Methods are provided to insert, remove, and
--- examine the element.  Each of these methods exists in two forms:
--- one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a
--- special value (either null or false, depending on
--- the operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is
--- designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted
--- Deque implementations; in most implementations, insert
--- operations cannot fail.
---
--- The twelve methods described above are summarized in the
--- following table:

---
--- This interface extends the Queue interface.  When a deque is
--- used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results.  Elements are
--- added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.  The methods
--- inherited from the Queue interface are precisely equivalent to
--- Deque methods as indicated in the following table:
---
---

---    pollFirst()
---
---
---    element()
---    getFirst()
---
---
---    peek()
---    peekFirst()
---
---
---
---
--- Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.  This
--- interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class.
--- When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the
--- beginning of the deque.  Stack methods are equivalent to Deque
--- methods as indicated in the table below:
---
---
--- Comparison of Stack and Deque methods
---
---
---     Stack Method
---     Equivalent Deque Method
---
---
---
---
---    push(e)
---    addFirst(e)
---
---
---    pop()
---    removeFirst()
---
---
---    peek()
---    getFirst()
---
---
---
---
--- Note that the peek method works equally well when
--- a deque is used as a queue or a stack; in either case, elements are
--- drawn from the beginning of the deque.
---
--- This interface provides two methods to remove interior
--- elements, removeFirstOccurrence and
--- removeLastOccurrence.
---
--- Unlike the List interface, this interface does not
--- provide support for indexed access to elements.
---
--- While Deque implementations are not strictly required
--- to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly
--- encouraged to do so.  Users of any Deque implementations
--- that do allow null elements are strongly encouraged not to
--- take advantage of the ability to insert nulls.  This is so because
--- null is used as a special return value by various methods
--- to indicate that the deque is empty.
---
--- Deque implementations generally do not define
--- element-based versions of the equals and hashCode
--- methods, but instead inherit the identity-based versions from class
--- Object.
---
--- This interface is a member of the
---
--- Java Collections Framework.
---@class Deque<E>: Queue<E>, SequencedCollection<E>
local __Deque = {}

---Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque
--- (in other words, at the tail of this deque) if it is possible to do so
--- immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning
--- true upon success and throwing an
--- IllegalStateException if no space is currently available.
--- When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to
--- use offer.
---
--- This method is equivalent to addLast(E).
---@param e E the element to add
---@return boolean # true (as specified by Collection.add(E))
function __Deque:add(e) end

---Adds all of the elements in the specified collection at the end
--- of this deque, as if by calling addLast(E) on each one,
--- in the order that they are returned by the collection's iterator.
---
--- When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable
--- to call offer separately on each element.
---
--- An exception encountered while trying to add an element may result
--- in only some of the elements having been successfully added when
--- the associated exception is thrown.
