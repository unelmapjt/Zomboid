---Hash table based implementation of the Map interface.  This
--- implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
--- null values and the null key.  (The HashMap
--- class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is
--- unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
--- the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
--- will remain constant over time.
---
--- This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
--- operations (get and put), assuming the hash function
--- disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
--- collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
--- HashMap instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
--- of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
--- capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
--- important.
---
--- An instance of HashMap has two parameters that affect its
--- performance: initial capacity and load factor.  The
--- capacity is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
--- capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
--- load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
--- get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
--- entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
--- current capacity, the hash table is rehashed (that is, internal data
--- structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately twice the
--- number of buckets.
---
--- As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good
--- tradeoff between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the
--- space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of
--- the operations of the HashMap class, including
--- get and put).  The expected number of entries in
--- the map and its load factor should be taken into account when
--- setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of
--- rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the
--- maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash
--- operations will ever occur.
---
--- If many mappings are to be stored in a HashMap
--- instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow
--- the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform
--- automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using
--- many keys with the same hashCode() is a sure way to slow
--- down performance of any hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys
--- are Comparable, this class may use comparison order among
--- keys to help break ties.
---
--- Note that this implementation is not synchronized.
--- If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of
--- the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be
--- synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
--- that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
--- associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
--- structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
--- synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
---
--- If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
--- Collections.synchronizedMap
--- method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
--- unsynchronized access to the map:
---   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));
---
--- The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
--- are fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
--- the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
--- remove method, the iterator will throw a
--- ConcurrentModificationException.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
--- modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
--- arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
--- future.
---
--- Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
--- as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
--- presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
--- throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.
--- Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
--- exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators
--- should be used only to detect bugs.

--- Java Collections Framework.
