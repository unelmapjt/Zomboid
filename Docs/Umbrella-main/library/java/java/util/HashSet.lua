---This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table
--- (actually a HashMap instance).  It makes no guarantees as to the
--- iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the
--- order will remain constant over time.  This class permits the null
--- element.
---
--- This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations
--- (add, remove, contains and size),
--- assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the
--- buckets.  Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of
--- the HashSet instance's size (the number of elements) plus the
--- "capacity" of the backing HashMap instance (the number of
--- buckets).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial capacity too
--- high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
---
--- Note that this implementation is not synchronized.
--- If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of
--- the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally.
--- This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that
--- naturally encapsulates the set.
---
--- If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
--- Collections.synchronizedSet
--- method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
--- unsynchronized access to the set:
---   Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
---
--- The iterators returned by this class's iterator method are
--- fail-fast: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is
--- created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove
--- method, the Iterator throws a ConcurrentModificationException.
--- Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
--- and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
--- an undetermined time in the future.
---
--- Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
--- as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
--- presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
--- throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.
--- Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
--- exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators
--- should be used only to detect bugs.
---
--- This class is a member of the
---
--- Java Collections Framework.

---Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present.
--- More formally, adds the specified element e to this set if
--- this set contains no element e2 such that
--- Objects.equals(e, e2).
--- If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set
--- unchanged and returns false.
---@param e E element to be added to this set
---@return boolean # true if this set did not already contain the specified
--- element

---Removes all of the elements from this set.
--- The set will be empty after this call returns.

---Returns a shallow copy of this HashSet instance: the elements
--- themselves are not cloned.
---@return any # a shallow copy of this set
function __HashSet:clone() end

---Returns true if this set contains the specified element.
--- More formally, returns true if and only if this set
--- contains an element e such that
--- Objects.equals(o, e).
---@param o any element whose presence in this set is to be tested
---@return boolean # true if this set contains the specified element

---Returns true if this set contains no elements.
---@return boolean # true if this set contains no elements

---Returns an iterator over the elements in this set.  The elements
--- are returned in no particular order.
---@return Iterator<E> # an Iterator over the elements in this set
function __HashSet:iterator() end

---Removes the specified element from this set if it is present.
--- More formally, removes an element e such that
--- Objects.equals(o, e),
--- if this set contains such an element.  Returns true if
--- this set contained the element (or equivalently, if this set
--- changed as a result of the call).  (This set will not contain the
--- element once the call returns.)
---@param o any object to be removed from this set, if present
---@return boolean # true if the set contained the specified element

---Creates a late-binding
--- and fail-fast Spliterator over the elements in this
--- set.

--- The Spliterator reports Spliterator.SIZED and

--- the reporting of additional characteristic values.
