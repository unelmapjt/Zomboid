---The Double class wraps a value of the primitive type
--- double in an object. An object of type
--- Double contains a single field whose type is
--- double.
---
--- In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a
--- double to a String and a
--- String to a double, as well as other
--- constants and methods useful when dealing with a
--- double.
---
--- This is a value-based
--- class; programmers should treat instances that are
--- equal as interchangeable and should not
--- use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
--- occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
---
--- Floating-point Equality, Equivalence,
--- and Comparison
---
--- IEEE 754 floating-point values include finite nonzero values,
--- signed zeros (+0.0 and -0.0), signed infinities
--- positive infinity and
--- negative infinity), and
--- NaN (not-a-number).
---
--- An equivalence relation on a set of values is a boolean
--- relation on pairs of values that is reflexive, symmetric, and
--- transitive. For more discussion of equivalence relations and object
--- equality, see the Object.equals
--- specification. An equivalence relation partitions the values it
--- operates over into sets called equivalence classes.  All the
--- members of the equivalence class are equal to each other under the
--- relation. An equivalence class may contain only a single member. At
--- least for some purposes, all the members of an equivalence class
--- are substitutable for each other.  In particular, in a numeric
--- expression equivalent values can be substituted for one
--- another without changing the result of the expression, meaning
--- changing the equivalence class of the result of the expression.
---
--- Notably, the built-in == operation on floating-point
--- values is not an equivalence relation. Despite not
--- defining an equivalence relation, the semantics of the IEEE 754
--- == operator were deliberately designed to meet other needs
--- of numerical computation. There are two exceptions where the
--- properties of an equivalence relation are not satisfied by
--- == on floating-point values:
---
---
---
--- If v1 and v2 are both NaN, then v1
--- == v2 has the value false. Therefore, for two NaN
--- arguments the reflexive property of an equivalence
--- relation is not satisfied by the == operator.
---
--- If v1 represents +0.0 while v2
--- represents -0.0, or vice versa, then v1 == v2 has
--- the value true even though +0.0 and -0.0
--- are distinguishable under various floating-point operations. For
--- example, 1.0/+0.0 evaluates to positive infinity while
--- 1.0/-0.0 evaluates to negative infinity and
--- positive infinity and negative infinity are neither equal to each
--- other nor equivalent to each other. Thus, while a signed zero input
--- most commonly determines the sign of a zero result, because of
--- dividing by zero, +0.0 and -0.0 may not be
--- substituted for each other in general. The sign of a zero input
--- also has a non-substitutable effect on the result of some math
--- library methods.
---
---
---
--- For ordered comparisons using the built-in comparison operators
--- (<, <=, etc.), NaN values have another anomalous
--- situation: a NaN is neither less than, nor greater than, nor equal
--- to any value, including itself. This means the trichotomy of
--- comparison does not hold.
---
--- To provide the appropriate semantics for equals and
--- compareTo methods, those methods cannot simply be wrappers
--- around == or ordered comparison operations. Instead, equals defines NaN arguments to be equal to each
--- other and defines +0.0 to not be equal to
--- -0.0, restoring reflexivity. For comparisons, compareTo defines a total order where
--- -0.0 is less than +0.0 and where a NaN is equal to itself
--- and considered greater than positive infinity.
---
--- The operational semantics of equals and
--- compareTo are expressed in terms of bit-wise converting the floating-point values to integral values.
---
--- The natural ordering implemented by compareTo is consistent with equals. That
--- is, two objects are reported as equal by equals if and only
--- if compareTo on those objects returns zero.
---
--- The adjusted behaviors defined for equals and
--- compareTo allow instances of wrapper classes to work properly with
--- conventional data structures. For example, defining NaN
--- values to be equals to one another allows NaN to be used as
--- an element of a HashSet or as the key of
--- a HashMap. Similarly, defining
--- compareTo as a total ordering, including +0.0,
--- -0.0, and NaN, allows instances of wrapper classes to be used as
--- elements of a SortedSet or as keys of a
--- SortedMap.
