---@meta _

---The class Math contains methods for performing basic
--- numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,
--- square root, and trigonometric functions.
---
--- Unlike some of the numeric methods of class
--- StrictMath, all implementations of the equivalent
--- functions of class Math are not defined to return the
--- bit-for-bit same results.  This relaxation permits
--- better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is
--- not required.
---
--- By default many of the Math methods simply call
--- the equivalent method in StrictMath for their
--- implementation.  Code generators are encouraged to use
--- platform-specific native libraries or microprocessor instructions,
--- where available, to provide higher-performance implementations of
--- Math methods.  Such higher-performance
--- implementations still must conform to the specification for
--- Math.
---
--- The quality of implementation specifications concern two
--- properties, accuracy of the returned result and monotonicity of the
--- method.  Accuracy of the floating-point Math methods is
--- measured in terms of ulps, units in the last place.  For a
--- given floating-point format, an ulp of a
--- specific real number value is the distance between the two
--- floating-point values bracketing that numerical value.  When
--- discussing the accuracy of a method as a whole rather than at a
--- specific argument, the number of ulps cited is for the worst-case
--- error at any argument.  If a method always has an error less than
--- 0.5 ulps, the method always returns the floating-point number
--- nearest the exact result; such a method is correctly
--- rounded.  A correctly rounded method is generally the best a
--- floating-point approximation can be; however, it is impractical for
--- many floating-point methods to be correctly rounded.  Instead, for
--- the Math class, a larger error bound of 1 or 2 ulps is
--- allowed for certain methods.  Informally, with a 1 ulp error bound,
--- when the exact result is a representable number, the exact result
--- should be returned as the computed result; otherwise, either of the
--- two floating-point values which bracket the exact result may be
--- returned.  For exact results large in magnitude, one of the
--- endpoints of the bracket may be infinite.  Besides accuracy at
--- individual arguments, maintaining proper relations between the
--- method at different arguments is also important.  Therefore, most
--- methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be
--- semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function is
--- non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise,
--- whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the
--- floating-point approximation.  Not all approximations that have 1
--- ulp accuracy will automatically meet the monotonicity requirements.
---
---
--- The platform uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with
--- int and long primitive types.  The developer should choose
--- the primitive type to ensure that arithmetic operations consistently
--- produce correct results, which in some cases means the operations
--- will not overflow the range of values of the computation.
--- The best practice is to choose the primitive type and algorithm to avoid
--- overflow. In cases where the size is int or long and
--- overflow errors need to be detected, the methods addExact,
--- subtractExact, multiplyExact, toIntExact,
--- incrementExact, decrementExact and negateExact
--- throw an ArithmeticException when the results overflow.
--- For the arithmetic operations divide and absolute value, overflow
--- occurs only with a specific minimum or maximum value and
--- should be checked against the minimum or maximum as appropriate.
---
--- IEEE 754 Recommended
--- Operations
---
--- The 2019 revision of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard includes
--- a section of recommended operations and the semantics of those
--- operations if they are included in a programming environment. The
--- recommended operations present in this class include sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, expm1, log, log10, log1p,
--- sinh, cosh, tanh, hypot, and pow.  (The sqrt
--- operation is a required part of IEEE 754 from a different section
--- of the standard.) The special case behavior of the recommended
--- operations generally follows the guidance of the IEEE 754
--- standard. However, the pow method defines different
--- behavior for some arguments, as noted in its specification. The IEEE 754 standard defines its operations to be
--- correctly rounded, which is a more stringent quality of
--- implementation condition than required for most of the methods in
--- question that are also included in this class.
